### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Travelcookie/Travelcookie** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Data Engineering course because Databases have my current interests.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Database basics with SQL, MySQL, MongoDB and Python.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Cats.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: They/Them
- âš¡ Fun fact: You will find cat hairs on your clothings and other daily things even after years of not living with a cat.
